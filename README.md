## Building

This monorepo project is built with lerna.

At the top level of the project, do

```
npm run build-complete
```

If this build succeeds, the packages `@qudtlib/core` and `@qudtlib/allunits` are ready to be published.

To fix code style issues reported during the build, do

```
npm run format-apply
```

## Updating units

The file `allunits/src/units.ts` is generated by `qudtlib-java/qudtlib-js-gen`. For this reason, that project includes
the `qudtlib-js` project (i.e. this project) as a git submodule. By default, a maven build of `qudtlib-java` generates
the units file, which should be pushed if it has changes.
